# string-calculator-kata
My first coding dojo working with Spring Calculator Kata in Pair Programming with some mates of Lean Mind, this work has been divided in
various iterations of 30 to 40 minutes each one, for access to the source code of the different iterations you should chagen between branches.

# Info
